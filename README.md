# HEALTHDEMIC

Healthdemic is a website developed for urgent medical conditions that any normal person may face. The website requires some basic details about the person like name, number, address, previous medical conditions, age, etc. These details should be filled so as to reduce panic at the time of emergency. For registered users they just have to enter the mobile number and they can use the services of this site. It notifies the nearby hospitals about the condition of the patient entered, if it is known what is happening, else there is an SOS button which can be pressed if the condition is unknown. There is a video call facility with the on-duty doctor available on the website and also some first aid videos for all kind of emergencies while the ambulance arrives or the patient is taken to the hospital in order to make maximum attempts to save lives.
